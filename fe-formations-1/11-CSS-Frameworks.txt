CSS Framework

List at least three sites you frequent that use each CSS framework: Bootstrap,
Foundation, and Material Design. To find out which framework the website uses,
Right Click and choose "View Source". For example, if you search for "bootstrap"
in the source, you should be able to see if file /bootstrap.css is included. If
the filename is different for any reason (rare and against best practices, but
it does occur), search the source code for col-sm-6 or col-md-8, etc. These will
tell you that it is indeed using Bootstrap.

Bootstrap is used by the sfarts.org. Foundation is used by designforgoodbham.com.
Material design framework is used by codepen.io.


Read the official documentation and analyze the three leading CSS frameworks in
this checkpoint. Why are some used in specific projects over others? What are
the deciding factors? Is it aesthetics, development team, or a particular feature
such as built-in animation or an advanced grid system?

Bootstrap utilizes a mobile first strategy so if mobile utilization was of
utmost importance Bootstrap would be a great choice. Foundation is also mobile
focused but provides more options for customization such as animation and
bleeding-edge flexgrid. The positives of Material Design include user
familiarity, streamlined implementation, and fast performance.

CSS frameworks save development time, create consistency, and enforce style
guidelines.
