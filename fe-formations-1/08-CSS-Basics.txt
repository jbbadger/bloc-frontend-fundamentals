CSS Basics

What is the difference between inline, internal, and external styling?
Which will you most commonly use? Inline styles one specific element, internal
styles a page, and external links to one or more pages to style.

Why are ID selectors inhibiting?
ID selectors inhibit because each element has a unique ID so the styling won’t
be broadly applicable.

Look at the HTML code below

<div class="foo">
  <!-- 1 -->
  <p></p>
   <!-- 2 -->
  <p></p>
  <div class="altfoo">
    <!-- 3 -->
    <p></p>
  </div>
</div>

Is the <div> with class altfoo an immediate child of the <div> with foo?
Why or why not?
Altfoo is an immediate child of foo because there isn’t another element
wrapping Altfoo.

Referring to the HTML code from above, which element(s) will the following
selector select?
.foo p{} Paragraph elements 1, 2, and 3.

Referring to the HTML code from above, which element(s) will the following
selector select?
.foo > p{} Paragraph elements 1 and 2.

Look at the HTML code below. What pseudo-class selector would you write to
select the first <p> element?
(Only the first one!) p:first-child{}

<div>
  <p class="text">One</p>
  <p class="text">Two</p>
  <p class="text">Three</p>
  <p class="text">Four</p>
</div>
