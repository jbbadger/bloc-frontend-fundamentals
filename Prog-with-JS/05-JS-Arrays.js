/*
Arrays

Describe an array.
An array is an indexed collection of items or more succinctly, a list.

In JavaScript can you have a single array with a string and a number in it?
Multiple data types can be stored within a single array but itâ€™s not a
recommended practice.

In JavaScript do arrays start at index 0 or index 1?
JavaScript uses zero-indexing.

Code

Using the clothes variable below use the push() method to add a new item to
the clothes array. The new item should be called pants.
*/

var clothes = ['collared shirt', 'shirt'];

// add code below

clothes.push('pants')

// add code above

console.log(clothes);
