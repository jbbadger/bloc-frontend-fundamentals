Javascript Variables

What type of variable name casing do you use in JavaScript? (think of snakes
or camels)
camelCase where the first word is lowercase and each additional word
begins with uppercase.

If you want to create a variable called mentor and set its value equal to the
name of your mentor, how would you do that?
var mentor = ‘Alex Rolfe’;

How would you then log the value of mentor to the console?
console.log(mentor); will output ‘Alex Rolfe’

Describe the difference between let, var, and const.
A const is a variable that cannot be reassigned or is always constant.
A let is a variable that can be reassigned a different value but is confined
to predetermined block of code.
Var can be reassigned and have a global scope.

Code

Using var, let and const create 3 variables that will hold your name, state,
and hair color.

*/

var name = ‘Jay’;
const hairColor = ‘Brown’;
let state = ‘Wisconsin’;
